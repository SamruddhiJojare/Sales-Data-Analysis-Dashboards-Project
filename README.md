# Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

üöÄ **Project Overview**  
This is an end-to-end data analysis project where I worked with a multi-table dataset covering 4 years (2020‚Äì2023) to analyze Sales, Customer, Product, and Location data. The project demonstrates the full analytics pipeline, from data modeling to analysis to creating interactive dashboards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau
- **Database Management**: SQL (for data extraction and manipulation)
- **Data Modeling**: Dimensional modeling (Fact & Dimension tables)

## üìä Project Description
The project is designed to provide insights into sales performance, customer engagement, and geographical trends. I utilized Tableau to create interactive dashboards that showcase key metrics and trends.

### Key Dashboards Built:
1. **Sales Dashboard**
    - KPIs with BANs showing Year-over-Year (YoY) growth
    - Stacked bar visual comparing current year vs previous year subcategory sales
    - Visual cues to highlight profit/loss months and peak performance
    - Weekly sales & profit trends with interactive tooltips
    

2. **Customer Dashboard**
    - KPIs tracking Year-over-Year customer behavior
    - Bar-in-bar visual showing YoY Order Comparison by Sub-Category
    - Diverging bar chart shows the positive and negative order differences across sub-categories to identify performance gaps.
    - Visual comparing monthly order trends between the Current Year and Previous Year to track growth or decline patterns over time.

3. **Location Dashboard**
    - State-wise Sales, Profit & Quantity on interactive maps
    - Region-wise stacked bar chart for demographic insights
    - YoY% monthly trend-lines to reveal seasonal patterns

## üîç Key Insights:
- **Sales Dashboard**:  
  2023 emerged as the most successful year, with the highest recorded sales, profit, and quantity sold.  
  A 2.8% decline in sales during 2021 compared to 2020 signaled a short-term dip, which was followed by a strong recovery in subsequent years.  
  The "Tables" sub-category showed consistent losses from 2020 to 2023.

- **Customer Dashboard**:  
  2023 marked the highest customer engagement with 693 customers, and 1687 orders, indicating strong customer retention.

- **Location Dashboard**:  
  California stood out as the top-performing state, contributing significantly to the West region's performance.

## üí° Project Flow:
- **Data Modeling**:  
  Identified fact and dimension tables to create a robust data model that laid the foundation for analysis.

- **Data Analysis**:  
  Analyzed sales trends, customer behavior, and geographical performance, uncovering valuable insights.

- **Dashboard Design**:  
  Focused on clean design, user-friendly interactivity, and clear visualizations that made complex data actionable.
